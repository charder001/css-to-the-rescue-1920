## What is this?
This is a project made for course CSS to the rescue for the minor web development. This app resembles all the things i've learned during this course. The basic concept is a restaurant menu. This menu, however, isn't fully visible/readable from the start. You'll have to work for that! 

You might notice the fact that your cursor changes to a plane when hovered over the main canvas. Your screen will also start to shake! This is because of turbulence, and ofcourse, with turbulence you can't read your menu. Hold your cursos between the copsticks you see on screen to trigger the menu to scroll down. Enjoy!

## What have i learned?
Before this course my only experience with CSS has been to style a few websites using fonts, colors, flexbox etc. The amazing thing about this assignment has been that we had a lot of creativity, and were encourage to try crazy things that would not fit into more conventional website designs. So, during the course i've stumbled into and learned from the following things:

- ### CSS Keyframing animations
I had never worked with these before, but after getting to know them i've learned how versatile they are and how many different applications these animations can have. There is definitely more cool stuff to explore with keyframed animations!

- repeat-x
This has been the most important property for me to execute my concept. There are some different ways to get a parralax in css, but this seemed like the most beginner friendly. However, i discovered when i wanted to include inline SVG as well, this property would not be available to me. It took me a few hours of tinkering before giving up because what i wanted to do was not just possible with my skillset. I have ended up with a combination of png's that repeat-x and a background gradient to get close to what i was going for in my head.

- Prefers reduced motion
Another new one for me, which was surprisingly easy to implement. I wasn't sure what extra i wanted to add to my contept (dark mode, print-stylesheet, etc.) but when i introduced motion into my concept, this media query was a no brainer. 

- linear-gradients
Also new to me, i wanted to include a day-night cycle into my concept. The prettiest and most elegant solution to me would be to add a CSS gradient to my background, which is exactly what i did. There are lots of amazing tools online to help you with creating the exact gradient you want (i used https://www.gradient-animator.com/ which worked amazingly).

## What else would i like to add
- Shake entire page
I tried almost an entire day (oops) trying to make the whole page move instead of just the ladscape. This turned out really hard because of the lack of parent selector in css. I tried many ways to structure my html and css but in the end i settled for the solution i have now. I would really like to add this though, as i think it would fit my concept really well.

- Make chopsticks move
Although i think this would be super hard withouth the use of JS, making you chase the chopsticks would have been great fun, adding a little more playfulness and friction to my concept. 

- Gradual transition from shake
Another one i wasted many hours on, but wasn't able to get to work in the end. More of a polish thing, but something i think would make the entire experience a lot more complete.

- Adding more interaction
Due to the time contraints in this project, i wasn't able to add as much interaction as i would have liked. The core concept has changed a bit due to some things not being possible because of my skill-set or the lack of time. I would have liked to expand on my concept a bit more adding extra interaction or perhaps even game-ifying the concept even more(almost like flappy bird maybe?) to a point where reading your menu would almost be an accomplishment in and of itself.
