## What is this?
This is a project made for course CSS to the rescue for the minor web development. This app resembles all the things i've learned during this course. The basic concept is a restaurant menu. This menu, however, isn't fully visible/readable from the start. You'll have to work for that! 

You might notice the fact that your cursor changes to a plane when hovered over the main canvas. Your screen will also start to shake! This is because of turbulence, and ofcourse, with turbulence you can't read your menu. Hold your cursos between the copsticks you see on screen to trigger the menu to scroll down. Enjoy!

## What have i learned?
Before this course my only experience with CSS has been to style a few websites using fonts, colors, flexbox etc. The amazing thing about this assignment has been that we had a lot of creativity, and were encourage to try crazy things that would not fit into more conventional website designs. So, during the course i've stumbled into and learned from the following things:

- CSS Keyframing animations
I had never worked with these before, but after getting to know them i've learned how versatile they are and how many different applications these animations can have. There is definitely more cool stuff to explore with keyframed animations!

- repeat-x
This has been the most important property for me to execute my concept. There are some different ways to get a parralax in css, but this seemed like the most beginner friendly. However, i discovered when i wanted to include inline SVG as well, this property would not be available to me. It took me a few hours of tinkering before giving up because what i wanted to do was not just possible with my skillset. I have ended up with a combination of png's that repeat-x and a background gradient to get close to what i was going for in my head.

- Prefers reduced motion
Another new one for me, which was surprisingly easy to implement. I wasn't sure what extra i wanted to add to my contept (dark mode, print-stylesheet, etc.) but when i introduced motion into my concept, this media query was a no brainer.
